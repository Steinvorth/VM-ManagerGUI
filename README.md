# VM-ManagerGUI
I have a home server with no access to ethernet wifi, i only have a wireless connection. I really wanted to use proxmox, but could not, so i made this WebGUI as an alternative to those who prefer to use a Linux Server Instance with QEMU KVM support. It supports docker container status, creation, deletion and access. It also supports creation of virtual machines using QEMU/KVM installes it automatically to the server, installes OpenVPN to the server to use remotely, and finally it lets you have control over everything with a GUI accessible over browser.

This project is meant for LOCAL HOMELAB INSTANCES. It does not support secure communication (yet atleast).
